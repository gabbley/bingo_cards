# BingoCards

This project will be able to produce 2 types of 5 x 5 bingo cards:
* Numbered bingo cards
* Custom-input bingo cards

## Numbered bingo cards

By default, the numbered bingo card will generate a random card using numbers between 1 - 75. Users may input a custom range of numbers.

## Custom bingo cards

Users will be able to provide a minimum of 25 words or phrases for their custom bingo card. Such bingo cards are often used for icebreakers or games.

This project will be able to export a given number of randomized bingo cards
into a PDF. It will have the options to export 1 per page or 2 per page.
